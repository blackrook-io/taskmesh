# Release notes

Human-readable notes for each finished TaskMesh version. Updated on every **finish up** in the same commit as the SemVer bump. Newest version blocks appear first (directly under this intro).

A future **Build release** skill will use this file to populate GitHub Release notes. After that publish clears or archives the working notes, the next finish-up must recreate this file from the stub below if it is missing or empty (header only — no version blocks), then prepend the new version entry.

## 0.50.1 — 2026-09-28

### Enhancements
- Finish-up on the development host merges to `main` and no longer deploys a local production process. The public Production site is upgraded by an Administrator from a GitHub Release.
- Task bookkeeping and schema-doc sync on this host use the DEV API on port 3001.

## Format

Each finished version is a heading plus only the non-empty sections below. Bullets are 1–3 concise sentences describing **outcome** (not the work process). Call out schema or public API breaks under **Breaking Changes**.

Omit any section with nothing to report. Do not keep an `Unreleased` section.
